        <p>Long ago in the ancient Yoruba city of <b>Oyo</b>, there was a king known as <b>Alaafin Sango</b>, 
        famous for his wisdom and power over lightning. In his palace was a gifted drummer named <b>Ayan</b>, 
        whose talking drum (<b>gángan</b>) could send messages across the land.</p>

        <p>One day, a far-off village faced danger from wild animals, but there was no time to send a messenger 
        on foot. Ayan took his talking drum, tightened its strings, and began to play. The drum spoke in Yoruba 
        tones, carrying the message over hills and forests:</p>

        <p><i>“The king calls! Danger is near! Come together!”</i></p>

        <p>Within minutes, warriors from surrounding villages arrived, ready to protect the people. The wild 
        animals were driven away, and peace returned.</p>

        <p>From that day, the people respected the talking drum not just as a musical instrument, but as a 
        <b>voice of unity and tradition</b>.</p>
